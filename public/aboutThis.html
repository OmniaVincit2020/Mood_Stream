		Mood Mapper Beta shows you a worldwide map of tweets, represented as colored circles, about any subject you'd like to see. Number of followers sets a circle's size, and the mood of the tweet sets the color: blue shows positivity, and red, negativity. Circles are centered at their tweet's origin.

		 To learn more about how the tweets are translated into mood, check out <a style='text-decoration:none' href='http://arxiv.org/pdf/1103.2903.pdf -- courtesy of Cornell University Library.'> this article</a>, written by the creator of the AFINN word list. In short, this app's analysis looks for AFINN words with a positive ("love") or negative ("hate") connotation, then increases red and/or blue accordingly. The brightness of a color will show you how extreme that mood is. You'll see a lot of gray tweets; those are the ones that did not have any AFINN words.</p>
