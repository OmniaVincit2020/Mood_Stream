		MyUnnamedApp translates tweets into colors based on their mood, then uses those colors to draw a circle, centered at the tweet's origin and sized by the tweeter's number of followers, on the map below. You'll have your choice of live streaming or seeing tweets up to a week old. </p>
<p class="formText lrg" style="line-height:125%"> 
		Determing a word's mood relies on the AFINN list. AFINN words have a score between -5 and 5, not including 0, where a score below 0 indicates a negative word, and above 0, a positive word. This app uses these scores to create red, blue, and green pixels for every tweet. Red represents a negative mood, while blue/green represents a positive mood. How bright a color is indicates the extremeness of the emotion: bright red means very negative, bright blue/green means very positive. All the grays and purples in between show some mix, or ambiguity, of emotion. All tweets begin as gray, then have their color pushed one way or the other as their words are scored. </p>
<p class="formText lrg" style="line-height:125%"> 
		Punctuation and capitalization are also taken into account. For instance, if a tweeter says, "I LOVE PUPPIES!!!!!", that will be scored as more strongly positive than "I love puppies.". Basic emojis are also detected, and are scored as words rather than punctuation. So, ":) :) :) :D PUPPIES." will also be a big scorer. </p>
<p class="formText lrg" style="line-height:125%">
